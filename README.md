# AddressBookUI
Verison 2.0 has been released!

This is the biggest update since I have release the first address book!

## Key Features

 - Stability and bug fixes
 
 ## How to Set Up your own server!
  If you want to run this on your own server there are some setting to change!
  In data.service.ts you will need to change the url variable to point to your REST api
  After that run the command `ng build --prod --base-href='directory-to-folder'`

  Download the dist folder avaiable under the releases tab.
  Make sure you change the base-href in the index.html to match with your server
